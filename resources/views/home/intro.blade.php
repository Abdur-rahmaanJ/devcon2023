				Being the largest IT Community in Mauritius, we are so passionate about the tech world that doing
				the Developers Conference is a must. With the Virtual Conference, we missed the human touch where
				people exchange and interact with each other.
		</p>
		<p>
				Mark your calendar, save the dates and join us for the Developers Conference 2023 with multiple
				sessions over 3 whole days of technical geekery as well as various evening entertainments. Come
				and meet our Partners for recruitment and internship opportunities at their different booths.
				We have some surprises also in store for you! So, come, and let's have some fun!
